            How Covid-19 has encouraged people to live more sustainably.
            <br />Is this a permanent or a temporary change?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The truth is that nothing is sure, and anything can happen, but
            although most things in life are unsure, you can always find
            something good in the not so good. Take the global pandemic Covid-19
            as an example. It is obvious that the novel coronavirus outbreak
            was, and in many places still is, an immense concern. As of today,
            it has infected over 22.4 million people, taken the lives of over
            seven hundred thousand people, caused the collapse of multiple
            healthcare systems, and forced us to stay indoors on bright and
            sunny days when we would rather be out on the beach.
            <sup><a href="#reference">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Never would I have thought that something that started 11,635 km
            from me would have had such an inordinate impact on my life.
            <sup><a href="#reference">[2]</a></sup> Nevertheless, did I think it
            would have a positive impact on the environment. But as said, there
            is always good that comes with bad, whether it is a lesson learned
            or a door filled with new opportunities. As many of us quarantined
            away at home due to Covid-19, nature was free to return home. Many
            breaking news headlines read “Wildlife returns as humans stay
            indoor” or “global pandemic helps the environment.” In Italy, we saw
            it all, from nitrogen dioxide levels dropping due to fewer cars on
            the road to the Grand Canal in Venice becoming crystal clear due to
            reduced boat pollution.
            <sup><a href="#reference">[3]</a></sup> These effects were not only
            seen in Italy but also in the Northeast United States. NASA
            satellite data found a 30% drop in air pollution over the Northeast
            United States, the lowest level since 2005.
            <sup><a href="#reference">[4]</a></sup> Quarantine also meant
            restrictions on airline travel, which is responsible for 8% of
            global greenhouse gases.
            <sup><a href="#reference">[5]</a></sup> This showed many people how
            human activity does indeed have a colossal impact on the
            environment. For those who don’t believe it until they see it, well
            there they had it, Covid-19 proved that there is a link between our
            careless actions and the health of our planet. This is one of the
            ways Covid-19 encouraged a few to live more sustainably. A
            sustainable lifestyle involves avoiding activities that contribute
            to the depletion of natural resources or increase greenhouse gases,
            all with the aim to maintain the health and ecological balance of
            our planet, our home. <sup><a href="#reference">[6]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Quarantine - eat, sleep, Netflix, and repeat, oh what a life. I
            think it’s safe to say that many of us went through this tiresome
            cycle at some point during quarantine, but some of us decided to
            break the cycle and learn new things. If this was not you, don’t
            worry, we all need a break sometimes. Anyway, some of us learned a
            new language, others learned how to cook, I learned how to use
            Photoshop, but most importantly, some of us decided to learn more
            about Covid-19. What is it? Where did it come from? How did it
            happen?
          </p>
          <p>
            Covid-19 originated in Wuhan, China in 2019 in a meat and poultry
            market that consisted of crowding wild animals that are considered a
            delicacy or exotic in China, such as porcupines, deer, civet cats,
            and bats. <sup><a href="#reference">[7]</a></sup> Crowding in
            factory farms is one of the most dangerous threats to a new
            pandemic, which has paralyzed many with fear of eating meat. As a
            result, there has been a reduction in meat consumption and
            subsequent closing of cattle ranches.
          </p>
          <p>
            With quarantine, people have also had more time to research other
            viruses. They have probably learned that most viruses are spread
            from animal to human and that the destruction of forests is what
            increases animal-human contact. This is because as we shrink the
            areas that animals can live in, they are forced into closer contact
            with humans. <sup><a href="#reference">[8]</a></sup> They have
            probably also learned that anthropogenic activities that increase
            greenhouse gases exert influence on extreme weather fluctuations
            such as droughts and storms.
            <sup><a href="#reference">[9]</a></sup> These droughts and storms
            affect the geographic location of the food sources of animals,
            shifting them towards geographic ranges that are closer to humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Covid-19 has created a great opportunity to change some of
            our practices to work in better partnership with nature, the media
            rarely covers climate change as exhaustively as they cover a
            dangerous disease, per se. As a result, people are sure to quickly
            forget about the impacts our actions have on planet Earth.
            Additionally, as cities lift the lockdown people are desperate to
            reboot the economic system, even if it’s at the expense of our
            environment. This means that the government may be willing to fund
            industries that will most securely bring back the economy. This
            includes fossil fuel hungry industries such as oil and coal
            companies, aviation companies, or car manufactures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, the environmental improvements seen since the start of
            Covid-19 might be temporary, but what you do next is not only
            permanent but crucial. So, what can you do next? Live more
            sustainably. Sustainability is not only important for environmental
            conservation, which entails the preservation, restoration, and
            protection of ecological communities that inhabit natural
            environments, but also for the health of our communities.
            Sustainability and healthcare are interconnected since the quality
            of our environment affects public health. For instance, numerous
            health problems are the direct result of poor air and water quality
            caused by anthropogenic activities. There are many ways you can
            contribute to living a more sustainable life, aside from consuming
            less meat or minimizing inefficient transportation methods. For
            instance, you can purchase
            <a href="lifestyle.html">sustainable alternatives</a> like reusable
            produce bags and bamboo toothbrushes, or you can visit the

            Thank you to the Eco Garden Future Solution Scholarship for
            encouraging me to share my thoughts and tips on sustainability in
            relation to Covid-19. The Eco Garden Future Solution Scholarship
            will provide me with financial security as I pursue my education in
            regulatory affairs for environmental legislation. With this title I
            will have the privilege to regulate the practices and strategies of
            innovative products or services and provide eco-efficient solutions
            to assure its compliance with environmental policies. With less
            financial stress about paying for my education, I will no longer
            have to make the difficult decision between purchasing the more
            affordable, but unsustainable product versus the more expensive, but
            better quality and eco- friendly product.
