            How Covid-19 has encouraged people to live more sustainably.
            <br />Is this a permanent or a temporary change?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The truth is that nothing is sure, and anything can happen, but
            although most things in life are unsure, you can always find
            something good in the not so good. Take the global pandemic Covid-19
            as an example. It is obvious that the novel coronavirus outbreak
            was, and in many places still is, an immense concern. As of today,
            it has infected over 21.6 million people, taken the lives of over
            seven hundred thousand people, caused the collapse of multiple
            healthcare systems, and forced us to stay indoors on bright and
            sunny days when we would rather be out on the beach.
            <sup><a href="#reference">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Never would I have thought that something that started 11,635 km
            from me would have had such a great impact on my life.
            <sup><a href="#reference">[2]</a></sup> Nevertheless, did I think it
            would have such a great and positive impact on the environment. But
            as said, there is always good that comes with bad, whether it is a
            lesson learned or a door filled with new opportunities. As many of
            us quarantined away at home due to Covid-19, nature was free to
            return home. Many breaking news headlines read “Wildlife returns as
            humans stay indoor” or “global pandemic helps the environment.” In
            Italy, we saw it all, from nitrogen dioxide levels dropping due to
            fewer cars on the road to the Grand Canal in Venice becoming crystal
            clear due to reduced boat pollution.
            <sup><a href="#reference">[3]</a></sup> These effects were not only
            seen in Italy but also in the Northeast United States. NASA
            satellite data found a 30% drop in air pollution over the Northeast
            United States, the lowest level since 2005.
            <sup><a href="#reference">[4]</a></sup> Quarantine also meant
            restrictions on airline travel, which is responsible for 8% of
            global greenhouse gases.
            <sup><a href="#reference">[5]</a></sup> This showed many people how
            human activity does indeed have a colossal impact on the
            environment. For those who don’t believe it until they see it, well
            there they had it, Covid-19 proved that there is a link between our
            careless actions and the health of our planet. This is one of the
            ways Covid-19 encouraged a few to live more sustainably.
          </p>
          <p>
            Quarantine - eat, sleep, Netflix, and repeat, oh what a life. I
            think it’s safe to say that many of us went through this tiresome
            cycle at some point during quarantine, but some of us decided to
            break the cycle and learn new things. If this was not you, don’t
            worry, we all need a break sometimes. Anyway, some of us learned a
            new language, others learned how to cook, I learned how to use
            Photoshop, but most importantly, some of us decided to learn more
            about Covid-19. What is it? Where did it come from? How did it
            happen?
          </p>
          <p>
            Covid-19 originated in Wuhan, China in 2019 in a meat and poultry
            market that consisted of crowding wild animals that are considered a
            delicacy or exotic in China, such as porcupines, deer, civet cats,
            and bats. <sup><a href="#reference">[6]</a></sup> Crowding in
            factory farms is one of the most dangerous threats to a new
            pandemic, which has paralyzed many with fear of eating meat. As a
            result, there has been a reduction in meat consumption and
            subsequent closing of cattle ranches.
          </p>
          <p>
            With quarantine, people have also had more time to research other
            viruses. They have probably learned that most viruses are spread
            from animal to human and that the destruction of forests is what
            increases animal-human contact. This is because as we shrink the
            areas that animals can live in, they are forced into closer contact
            with humans.
            <sup><a href="#reference">[7]</a></sup> They have probably also
            learned that anthropogenic activities that increase greenhouse gases
            exert influence on extreme weather fluctuations such as droughts and
            storms. <sup><a href="#reference">[8]</a></sup> These droughts and
            storms affect the geographic location of the food sources of
            animals, shifting them towards geographic ranges that are closer to
            humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Covid-19 has created a great opportunity to change some of
            our practices to work in better partnership with nature, the media
            rarely covers climate change as exhaustively as they cover a
            dangerous disease, per se. As a result, people are sure to quickly
            forget about the impacts our actions have on planet Earth.
            Additionally, as cities lift the lockdown people are desperate to
            reboot the economic system, even if it’s at the expense of our
            environment. This means that the government may be willing to fund
            industries that will most securely bring back the economy. This
            includes fossil fuel hungry industries such as oil and coal
            companies, aviation companies, or car manufactures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, the environmental improvements seen since the start of
            Covid-19 might be temporary, but what you do next is not only
            permanent but crucial. There are many ways you can continue to
            contribute to living a more sustainable life, aside from consuming
            less meat or minimizing inefficient transportation methods. For
            instance, you can purchase
            <a href="lifestyle.html">sustainable alternatives</a>
            like reusable produce bags and bamboo toothbrushes, or you can visit

            Thank you to the Eco Garden Future Solution scholarship for
            encouraging me to share my thoughts and tips on sustainability in
            relation to Covid-19. The Eco Garden Future Solution scholarship
            will provide me with financial security as I pursue my education in
            regulatory affairs. With less financial stress about paying for my
            education, I will no longer have to make the difficult decision
            between purchasing the more affordable, but unsustainable product
            versus the more expensive, but better quality and eco-friendly
            product.
